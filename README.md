Hi every body.
I am Masoud Noursaid, a senior website developer.
I live in Iran Mashhad. I have a lovely daughter.
I have a lot of experience in producing and developing websites and online information systems.
I have been working in this field for ten years.
I have experience in setting up an online plane ticket purchase system, an independent real estate system, a life insurance sales management system, a management and supervision system for food production, distribution and cosmetics, an information management system for measuring sensors, and so on.
During my professional career, I have had a lot of experience working with professional and creative programmers as well as successful entrepreneurs. I try to bring the organization closer and closer to my goal and purpose and make the goals available to them.
My focus is on .NET technologies on Backend and JavaScript technologies on Frontend.
